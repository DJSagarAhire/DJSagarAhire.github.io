About The Site
---------------

Hello readers! Glad to see you on *Sagar on Programming*! Here I'll put up posts about anything that I'm personally learning and/or something that I find interesting related to programming. I imagine the content of the site to be in a constant state of flux, but for now, the main types of content which I may cover on this page are as follows:

1. **Python and Java Programming**: I really like programming in Python and Java, and whenever I find some interesting way to do things in either of the 2 languages, I'll be sure to share it here...

2. **Algorithms**: Some posts about classic algorithms will definitely show up. This will include implementations and applications of various commonly-used data structures, as also algorithm paradigms like dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer.

3. **Competitive Programming**: This will include solutions and approaches to interesting questions encountered on competitive programming websites such as Codechef_, Hackerrank_, SPOJ_, etc. *Do not look at the solutions before solving the problems first!*

4. **Interview Questions**: While these are available dime-a-dozen on the Internet, for some reason they never seem to be enough! Here I'll post about questions I have read about and/or encountered myself in Computer Science interviews, again with a thorough dissection. There may be significant overlaps with Algorithms and Competitive Programming questions, but it seems that is how interviews work.

5. **Interesting Tools and Packages**: This will include any interesting tools or packages I come across that do a wonderful job of performing some task, including some tips and tricks.

6. **State-of-the-Art Research**: I'll also discuss the latest goings-on in the research arena, which will delve deep into published papers and their analysis, including, if I'm feeling like it, implementations! I'll mainly be dealing with Natural Language Processing in particular and Artificial Intelligence in general, but there's always the possibility of finding something interesting outside these fields!

7. **Personal Projects**: If I ever do a decent-sized personal project, be rest assured it will be discussed thread-bare over here.

8. **Miscellaneous**: Other topics include tech news relating to programming, and generic opinions, although posts carrying these will likely be very few in number.

About The Author
-----------------

I'm Sagar Ahire, currently pursuing my MTech in Computer Science & Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B). I'm mainly working in the field of Natural Language Processing and have taken courses in AI, Cryptography, Probability, Algorithms, and more. I love programming in Python and Java.

I'll be sure to upload an updated version of my resume soon.

| Until next time,
| Happy Programming!
