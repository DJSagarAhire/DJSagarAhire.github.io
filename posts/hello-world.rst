In true programming tradition, let's begin the journey of this page with a "Hello World" greeting. Hello, I'm Sagar Ahire, and this is my new blog which will discuss stuff related to programming.

.. TEASER_END

While I've mainly made this page to document whatever I'm learning myself, I've decided to make it public because, thanks to the power of the Internet, it is now possible for somebody's personal journal to benefit somebody else in ways which the original content creator cannot even anticipate! See the `About Page`_ to get an idea of what topics I may cover (which is, naturally, subject to change).

I hope my updates to this page are regular and that you will enjoy reading them!

*A word about how this site was built*:

I used the really cool static site generator Nikola_ to build this site. It's really easy to use and once you install it and create a site locally, you are pretty much ready to go as far as the site is concerned. To deploy it, you need to push the ``output\`` directory to your web server, which, in this case, is a github repository made possible via `Github Pages`_, which is, again, quick and easy. I will probably post more about Nikola and Github (pages or otherwise), but that is for some other post.

| Until next time,
| Happy Programming!
