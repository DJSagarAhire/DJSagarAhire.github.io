<div class="section" id="web-applications-or-webapps">
<h2>Web Applications (or "Webapps")</h2>
<p>So what is a web application? Put simply, a web application is an application that runs in a web browser. Of course, things are not really that simple! There are several ways to view webapps and tons of books and web pages are written on this subject. I'll summarize the concept of a webapp by breaking it down into its components.</p>
<p>Usually, a web application has two parts: the Client side and the Server side. The <em>Client side</em> of the webapp is the part which is actually sent over the Internet by the server to a web browser when a user requests the page. On the other hand, the <em>Server Side</em> of the webapp is the part which resides on the server, waiting for the client to perform an action and take actions of its own when it receives a client request.</p>
<p>The code that executes at the client essentially takes the form of a web page. Webpages are made by combining the following three technologies, each of which performs a separate function:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>
<strong>HTML</strong>: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language which specifies the content of the page. While I assume everybody who is reading this has at least a basic knowledge of HTML, a common misconception needs to be cleared at this point - HTML does <em>not</em> indicate the presentation of the content; it only states the content itself. The abundance of styling tags in the now-deprecated HTML 4 created this problem, which has largely been fixed in HTML 5. Which brings us to...</li>
<li>
<strong>CSS</strong>: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that enables specification of styling for the content in a web page. Style can be applied in any one of three possible locations: Within the <tt class="docutils literal">style</tt> attribute of an HTML tag, applicable only to the tag; Within the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;head&gt;</tt> tag of a document, applicable to the entire document; or in an external CSS document, available to all documents the CSS file is imported in.</li>
<li>
<strong>Javascript</strong>: While HTML and CSS can create and present content respectively, once the Webpage has been sent from the server, there is no way to modify it! Javascript solves this problem and enables modification of webpages by running code which is executed <em>at the client</em>. This allows web pages to be made dynamic, and due to the explosion of webapps, has become one of the most widely used programming languages today.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, the code that executes at the server waits for a request, and once a request arrives from the client, performs actions based on it. This code runs on the server, and is often referred to as the "backend" (as opposed to the client side, which is called the "frontend"). It is possible to write code for this in essentially any programming language, although frameworks have been made in several languages that make it easier to write backend code. Languages popular for backend development include Java (with frameworks like <a class="reference external" href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/">Spring</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a>), Ruby (with the highly popular <a class="reference external" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> framework), PHP (with <a class="reference external" href="http://php.net/">vanilla PHP</a> as well as frameworks like <a class="reference external" href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>), Javascript (with <a class="reference external" href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> for server-side code) and, of course, Python (with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and Flask among others).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flask-an-introduction">
<h2>Flask: An Introduction</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> is a Python web framework based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and "good intentions". It is one of the two leading web frameworks for Python (the other being Django). It is interesting to contrast the approaches taken by the two frameworks. While Django supplies all the peripheral components required for web development such as its own ORM (for communicating with a database), Flask chooses to not impose itself, giving the bare essentials while asking the programmer to make a choice for the rest of the components. While this makes Django a great choice if it suits your workflow, Flask is great if you require flexibility. It is also a really good choice for learning web development as you get to know what is happening under the hood.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we can start developing out first web application using Flask!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-1-hello-flask">
<h2>Step 1: Hello Flask</h2>
<p>The very first version of our web page will simply create a web page with the words "Hello World" in it and send it back to the client. The code for that is as follows:</p>
<p>File: <tt class="docutils literal">app.py</tt></p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="ln"> 1 </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="ln"> 2 </span>
<span class="ln"> 3 </span><span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="ln"> 4 </span>
<span class="ln"> 5 </span><span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'/'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="ln"> 6 </span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="ln"> 7 </span>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">"Hello World!"</span>
<span class="ln"> 8 </span>
<span class="ln"> 9 </span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"__main__"</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="ln">10 </span>    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>
<p>You can punch in this code in your favourite text editor and save it as a file with a <tt class="docutils literal">.py</tt> extension (You are advised to create a separate directory, as web applications are known to balloon in size and you'd want to keep all its files together). Then open a command prompt and type in:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
python app.py
</pre>
<p>Flask will start up a local server and specify its address (usually <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</span></tt>). Go there and you'll see our webpage shouting out "Hello World!" in all its glory!</p>
<p>So, what just happened? Let's walk through the code we just wrote. Line 1 imports the <tt class="docutils literal">Flask</tt> application constructor from the <tt class="docutils literal">flask</tt> module. Then, using it, we create an object representing our application in Line 3. In Line 5, we define a <em>route</em> for the web application, in this case, <tt class="docutils literal">/</tt>. Thus, if the URL of the application is <tt class="docutils literal">www.example.com</tt>, then going to <tt class="docutils literal">www.example.com/</tt> will invoke the function defined for the route. If the route were <tt class="docutils literal">/index</tt>, then its corresponding URL would have been <tt class="docutils literal">www.example.com/index</tt>. The next two lines state what happens when a user goes to the specified route - he is returned the string "Hello World". Finally, <tt class="docutils literal">app.run()</tt> runs the Flask server when the script is invoked from the command line, the way we just did.</p>
<p>Well, that wasn't so hard, was it? But that wasn't very impressive either. We want to be able to write more than just "Hello World"! Also, where's the HTML and/or CSS? For that, we move on to the next version of our "Hello World" webapp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-hello-templates">
<h2>Step 2: Hello Templates</h2>
<p>As we saw in the previous section, once the user visits a route in our app, the function associated with it is invoked and whatever is specified in the <tt class="docutils literal">return</tt> statement is sent back to the requesting browser. So, if we need to send back a pretty HTML page, we need to return HTML from the function.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to write HTML code within the Python file itself, treating it as a string. While this is indeed possible, this would be an extremely ugly and inflexible approach because the webpage would be tied to the Python code. And what if you need to return the same HTML with a very few minor changes from another route? You may need to copy over the entire HTML code within your Python script, and in general this would create a maintainability nightmare. A solution to this problem is Templates.</p>
<p><em>Templates</em> are files where you can write HTML code and simply ask Flask to render them whenever required. This way, the HTML is separated from the Python program and can be used in multiple places in the code without creating problems. All you need to do in the Python program is call the <tt class="docutils literal">render_template()</tt> function, passing in the HTML template file, and Flask will render the template for you as a Python string, ready to be sent over to the client.</p>
<p>Templates need to be created in a special directory <tt class="docutils literal">\templates</tt> inside the project. So, what are we waiting for? Let's create one!</p>
<p>File: <tt class="docutils literal">templates\index.html</tt></p>
<pre class="code html literal-block">
<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Hello World!<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>

    <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello World!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>This is simply a standard HTML page. The <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;head&gt;</tt> tag imports the <a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> web design framework via a CDN. Even though we aren't explicitly using any of its features here, its default settings give the webpage a nice, pleasing look.</p>
<p>To bring this template into action in our Flask webapp, we need to modify our Python file as follows:</p>
<p>File: <tt class="docutils literal">app.py</tt></p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="ln"> 1 </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">render_template</span>
<span class="ln"> 2 </span>
<span class="ln"> 3 </span><span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="ln"> 4 </span>
<span class="ln"> 5 </span><span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'/'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="ln"> 6 </span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="ln"> 7 </span>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">render_template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"index.html"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="ln"> 8 </span>
<span class="ln"> 9 </span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"__main__"</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="ln">10 </span>    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>
<p>The only modifications required are importing of the function <tt class="docutils literal">render_template</tt> from the <tt class="docutils literal">flask</tt> module, and then calling it in the <tt class="docutils literal">index()</tt> function rather than returning just a string.</p>
<p>On running this version of the Python script, instead of just a string, you get the HTML page, complete with header formatting!</p>
<p>However, this isn't very useful either - it's still a static web page. We still cannot react to user input or make decisions based on certain factors. For that, we move on to the next version of our Hello World app!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-hello-world">
<h2>Step 3: Hello World!</h2>
<p>So far our application has no ability to respond to the requests of the outside world as it is still an unchanging webpage. However, in this version of the app, we introduce the real power of Flask, which allows an application to accept user input and respond to it.</p>
<p>One way of accepting user input in a webpage is a form. So let's add a form to our template page which asks the user his/her name. Add the following form in our template file before the closing <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;/body&gt;</tt> tag:</p>
<p>File: <tt class="docutils literal">templates\index.html</tt></p>
<pre class="code html literal-block">
<span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"form-inline"</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">"/"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"txtName"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Enter your name:<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"name"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"txtName"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

    <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"btn btn-default"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Submit<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>While this form won't do anything just yet because we haven't handled the request yet, you can notice that when we click on Submit, we are returned back to the same page (due to the form's <tt class="docutils literal">action</tt> attribute). This is set up so that we can now handle the request by modifying this very page!</p>
<p>Note that by default, whenever a form gets submitted, it sends a request of type <tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt> to the server, packing in the values entered in the form using the <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> attribute of the form inputs. Flask provides a way to access these <em>arguments</em> of the GET request via the <tt class="docutils literal">request</tt> object. While the <tt class="docutils literal">request</tt> object is vast and extremely powerful, the only information we need right now from it is the arguments of the GET request, which can be obtained by using the <tt class="docutils literal">request.args.get()</tt> function and passing in the name of the form control. If corresponding data does not exist, the function returns <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>.</p>
<p>This data from the request can then be passed onward to the template using keyword arguments on the <tt class="docutils literal">render_template()</tt> function, so that the template can then display it! Let's make the appropriate changes to our Python file to make that happen:</p>
<p>File: <tt class="docutils literal">app.py</tt></p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="ln"> 1 </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">render_template</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span>
<span class="ln"> 2 </span>
<span class="ln"> 3 </span><span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="ln"> 4 </span>
<span class="ln"> 5 </span><span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'/'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="ln"> 6 </span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="ln"> 7 </span>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">render_template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"index.html"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="ln"> 8 </span>
<span class="ln"> 9 </span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"__main__"</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="ln">10 </span>    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>
<p>Once again, the changes are extremely minimal - one import and one modification to the <tt class="docutils literal">render_template()</tt> function call. The call to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">request.args.get("name")</span></tt> looks for data in the GET request with the name <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> and if such data is found, it is returned, else it returns <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>. This is then passed as an argument to <tt class="docutils literal">render_template()</tt> with the name <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> (any name is fine).</p>
<p>Now, the template has received this data. How do we incorporate this user-submitted data inside our HTML page? This is where we find the power behind Flask templates.</p>
<p>Once the template receives data using a keyword argument to <tt class="docutils literal">render_template()</tt>, this data becomes available to it, and can be printed within the template using special syntax! For example, in order to print the contents of the <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> keyword argument, you can use <tt class="docutils literal">{{ name }}</tt>. This can be done anywhere in the template file and <tt class="docutils literal">render_template()</tt> will do the job of replacing the brace-bracketed statement with the contents of the keyword argument passed to the function.</p>
<p>In addition, it is also possible to use conditions such as <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> and even loops such as <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> within templates! These can be used to modify the contents of the webpage depending on requirements. For instance, if an error occurs, you can create a conditional block with <tt class="docutils literal">{% if error %}</tt> and include an error message.</p>
<p>We now modify the template to display the user's name when a name is entered, or simply "Hello World" otherwise:</p>
<p>File: <tt class="docutils literal">templates\index.html</tt></p>
<pre class="code html literal-block">

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">{% if name %}</tt> statement handles the case when the name is not entered, and thus, the <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> variable is <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>. This happens when the page is first loaded, for example.</p>
<p>Now, when the Python script is run, you can enter your name, and see the server respond by greeting you!</p>
<p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<p>The code is available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DJSagarAhire/blog-code/tree/master/004">github repository</a> accompanying the site.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Modify the Hello World webapp to greet the user with "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", "Good Evening" or "Good Night", depending on the time at the server.</p>
